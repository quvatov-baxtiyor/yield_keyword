This code defines a generator function fetch_lines() that
yields lines from a file specified by the filename argument.
The purpose of using a generator function here is to
read lines from the file lazily, one at a time,
rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.
This approach is memory-efficient, especially for large files,
as it avoids loading the entire file into memory,
which can lead to memory consumption issues for very large files.
